# geoDeltaAudit

Geographic crosswalks are directional allocations, not inverses.  
`geoDeltaAudit` helps quantify how much a variable changes *purely* due
to boundary translation and allocation rules (pathway dependence).

## What it does

- Defines step functions for common geographic transformations (e.g.,
  ZCTA → ZIP → county)
- Runs an audit pipeline that reports:
  - fan-out and loss at each step
  - unmapped or duplicated units
  - Δx(VAR): change induced solely by transformation choices, holding
    the source constant

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("phinnphace/geoDeltaAudit")
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:


``` r
library(geoDeltaAudit)
## basic example code
```

# geoDeltaAudit

Geographic crosswalks are directional allocations, not inverses.
`geoDeltaAudit` helps you quantify how much a variable changes purely
due to boundary translation + allocation rules (pathway dependence).

## What it does

- Defines step functions for common transformations (e.g., ZCTA → ZIP,
  ZIP → county)
- Runs an audit pipeline that reports:
  - fan-out / loss at each step
  - unmapped units
  - Δx(VAR): change induced solely by transformation choices (holding
    the underlying source constant)

## Install

\`\`\`r install.packages(“remotes”)
remotes::install_github(“phinnphace/geoDeltaAudit”)
